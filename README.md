# Daily Learning
A big part of our culture at Center Centre is to promote learning. Every day, there's an opportunity to learn something new or different. We then think about how this affects how we'll approach our process in the (near or long-term) future.
## The question
What did I learn today (or recently) and how might it change my approach in the future?
