## Copy a Google Drive Folder
Did you know you can’t simply copy a folder in Google Drive? There’s no menu shortcut like there is to “Make a Copy” of a document. Found this out when I went to make a duplicate of our Cohort 01 courses.

Coping the entire Google Drive folder for the Cohort 01 courses into a Cohort 02 folder is being done through a script developed by Eric  Dauenhauer (http://ericyd.com/) called *_Copy Folder for Google Drive_* https://script.google.com/a/macros/centercentre.com/s/AKfycbxbGNGajrxv-HbX2sVY2OTu7yj9VvxlOMOeQblZFuq7rYm7uyo/exec

The total number of files for Cohort 01 ended up being 1071! …. Google has a thing about scripts running for a length of time or for a number of files. The script generates a great spreadsheet that tells you the progress and when those pauses occur. If the pause is too long, the script allows you to `resume` from the point in last left off. Very nice

When the process is complete, the Google Sheet (in cell C2) puts a green box with the words “Complete” (under the title of “Progress” in cell C1).

In the future, we’ll use this option to archive courses, cohort folders, and student files and projects - and share it with others, needing to duplicate folders in Google Drive.
