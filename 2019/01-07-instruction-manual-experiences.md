## The craziness of instruction manuals


During home renovations, we purchased a nail gun and air compressor, a pain sprayer, and a filtered face mask.
Of these three, the instructions for the filter mask took up the same square footage as the instructions for running an air compressor. The actual how-to-assemble the mask took up (what seemed to be) maybe 10% of the whole paper that seemed to measure four feet by four feet. The illustrations were small and not easily understood. The text that walked through the illustrations was not next to the illustrations. The text was vertically aligned and the illustrations were horizontal, making it even more difficult to know what to do.
The paint sprayer actually had a full manual and a quick guide full-color manual. It was simple to get started and easy to find "more information" in the full manual (booklet), if you needed it. Plus, the company did a great job of creating video playlists on You Tube!

In the future, in any project I lead or work on (with our without students), I'll keep these pros and cons in mind. Many folks, like myself, work well with short bits of information that are well organized. Illustrations are helpful, but only if they're understood and large enough to see. Redesigning manuals that are frustrating could be a good exercise in Information Architecture and Visual Design.
