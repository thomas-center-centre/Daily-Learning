## Dark vs Light Themes
After upgrading to Mojave on the MacOS, I selected the Dark Theme to try. After a few days, I realized the Dark Theme made it more difficult for me to sort and read email (along with a feeling of eye fatigue with so much reverse contrast).
I moved to the Light Theme and have had a more enjoyable experience with having a light background in email - while still having a code editor with a dark background. It's a good to be able to switch back and forth.
In the future, I want to talk more with students about choosing reverse contrast. Have them test out using applications with a lot of dark background / light text for a long length of time and compare it to a light background / dark text. If we do another documentation site, how might we allow users to switch? I'll think more about this, as we start to prepare for Cohort 02 and adding in more visual design achievements.
